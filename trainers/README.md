# Training Pipeline

## Utility Functions

Please finish all the `TODO`s in `train_utils.py`.

You can execute the following commands to test your implementations:
```bash
python3 train_utils.py

# Or, at the root directory.
python3 -m trainers.train_utils
```

If it prints out:

```bash
Your `mask_tokens` function is correct!
Your `pairwise_accuracy` function is correct!
```
Then you should be all set!  
Otherwise, please check your implementation again as highly there are something wrong.


## Training and Evluation Loops

Please make sure to read through most of the codes in `train.py` so as to  
get familiar with the major training and evaluation paradigm of this standard NLP training.  
Please finish all the `TODO` blocks following the comments.
